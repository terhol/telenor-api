# telenor-api
Assignment project


In a basic Dockerized Springboot Maven application, build a single REST API endpoint that returns a filtered set of products from the provided data in the data.csv file

`GET /product`

Query Parameter			     |       Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- type					     |   The productEntity type. (String. Can be 'phone' or 'subscription')
- min_price				     |   The minimum price in SEK. (Number)
- max_price				     |   The maximum price in SEK. (Number)
- city					     |   The city in which a store is located. (String)
- property				     |   The name of the property. (String. Can be 'color' or 'gb_limit')
- property:color		     |	 The color of the phone. (String)
- property:gb_limit_min      |	 The minimum GB limit of the subscription. (Number)
- property:gb_limit_max      |	 The maximum GB limit of the subscription. (Number)

The expected response is a JSON array with the products in a 'data' wrapper. 

Example: GET /product?type=subscription&max_price=1000&city=Stockholm
{
	data: [ 
		{
		    type: 'subscription',
		    properties: 'gb_limit:10',
		    price: '704.00',
		    store_address: 'Dana gärdet, Stockholm'
	  	},
	  	{
		    type: 'subscription',
		    properties: 'gb_limit:10',
		    price: '200.00',
		    store_address: 'Octavia gränden, Stockholm'
	  	}
	]
}

Your solution should correctly filter any combination of API parameters and use some kind of a datastore.
All parameters are optional, all minimum and maximum fields should be inclusive (e.g. min_price=100&max_price=1000 should return items with price 100, 200... or 1000 SEK). 
The applications does not need to support multiple values (e.g. type=phone,subscription or property.color=green,red).

We should be able to:
- build the application with Maven
- build the Docker image and run it
- make requests to verify the behavior

Please provide an archive with the source code and a list of the terminal commands to build and run the application.

## Tools
Following are the tools needed to build and run the project:
- Maven
- Docker

## How to run
Following are the commands that are needed to run from project root directory

    $ mvn clean package
    $ docker build -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker .
    $ docker run -p 8080:8080 -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
    
After that one can test with sample requests. Example is given in the following section. After finish run following commands:
    
    $ docker ps
   
Now you have the container id. Run the following command with container id:
   
    $ docker stop container_id
    
In fact, you can use `ctrl+c` which will stop the container. 

## Sample Request
One can use postman to make the following request:

    http://localhost:8080/product?type=subscription&max_price=1000&city=Stockholm

Or can use curl from command line (given that curl is available in your terminal):
    
    $ curl -i http://localhost:8080/product?type=subscription&max_price=1000&city=Stockholm
    
## Test
For running test following is the command:
    
    $ mvn test
